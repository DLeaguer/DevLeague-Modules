# XML HTTP Requests (XHR)

## Pre-Requisites
This material should come after *callbacks*, *Asynchronous programming*, and *SCSS* and before **Node Servers**. We have sen that XHR makes a great introduction to servers and communication between servers and clients.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 1 hour day to introduce and 1 full day of activities.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce XHR (whiteboard a diagram)
  1. Discuss it's importance in modern web app architecture
  1. Check out XHR requests being made on common web apps in the Chrome Dev Tools
1. Present **Asynchronous HTTP Requests - XHR** Slideshow: [Asynchronous HTTP Requests - XHR](http://slides.com/joecarlson/xhr)
1. Discuss Fetch API and how it differs from XHR
1. Livecode *Makeing a XHR request* with the class - make sure everyone can make a simple XHR request
1. Assign **Rebirth of Reddit**: [Rebirth of Reddit](https://github.com/devleague/rebirth-of-reddit)
1. [Optional] Assign **Fastenate**: [Fastenate](https://github.com/devleague/fastenate)
1. Assign **Getty Images Search Engine** as a morning challenge: [Getty Images Search Engine](https://gist.github.com/JoeKarlsson1/5f65e57b7d050b74caebf6d5e93c2c69)
1. Check in with students and their understanding of **XHR**, **JSON**, and **callback functions** (talk)
1. Verify that students have met the minimum required understanding before moving on.
