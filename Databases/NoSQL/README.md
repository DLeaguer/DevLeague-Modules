# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructions can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce NoSQL vs Relational Databases
1. Present **NoSQL** Slide Deck: [https://github.com/devleague/slides-nosql](https://github.com/devleague/slides-nosql)
1. Assign [MongoDB practice](./MongoDbPractice.md)
    - can alternatively run your own practice via repl
1. Check in on students - assign small groups and whiteboard differences between NoSQL and Relational databases to one another
1. _DEPRECATED_ Refactor **PixelPainter** assignment by adding NoSQL database using Mongoose
1. Assign [Express Gallery Photo Metadata Exercise](./Express-Gallery-Photo-Metadata-Exercise.md)
1. Verify
