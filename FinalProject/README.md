1. Introduce the final Project
1. Brainstorm ideas for the final project
  1. Vet out projects ideas by doing research and building out sample projects
1. Split into groups and start building out final projects
1. Cover [Git Flow](https://github.com/devleague/DevLeague-Modules/tree/master/Git/Git%20Flow)
1. Near the end of the project, cover [Deployment](https://github.com/devleague/DevLeague-Modules/tree/master/Deployment)

        - Tasks do not exist if they are not on the board.
- The project must be able to be designed, developed, and deployed from start to finish with the alotted project time - This is based on the descretion of the instructors.
- The project must be developed only by the team members - not outside help.

- A Good DevLeague Project Has the follwoing (Pick 2):

    - Lots of data, aggregates, D3, tells story, use of APIs
  - **Visually engaging**
    - Better than Meteorites, Not better than Norsecorp
  - **Interactive**
    - UGC, useful, fun, impressive

## Suggestions
The following are not rules, but suggestions based on previous successful final projects:
- The project should be sufficently challenging and introduce new topics to the students.
    - Emphasizing and demonstrating ability to learn new skills
- Projects with a focus on data visualization utilizing D3.js.
- Projects wiht a focus on helping contribute to Hawaii or local government.
- The project should be about something all groups
- Avoid 'Hackathon' type projects. Must have depth, and must keep everyone in the group busy developing.

## Resources
More often than not there is data out there without an API for it. For example, there might not be an API available to retreive data about the [migration of coconuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4_9kDO3q0w) but instead the data exists as an excel spreadsheet somewhere on the web.

Now you can build something to consume excel spreadsheets which will then populate a database, you will then serve that data through an API you build.

Wow, you just built a tool for other developers to use while also creeating the project you wanted! DOUBLE WHAMMY :sparkles:
