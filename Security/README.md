- Students should **know about** rotateing security keys.

#### Web Security
- Students should **grok** importance and purpose of `https`.

- Students should **know** how to set up LetsEncrypt certification to secure their servers.
- Students should **know** what a cron job is, and how to use it.
- Students should **know about** `http/2` and its involvment with security.

# Suggested Format of Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce Security as it relates to personal protection.
    - Explain why DNS is important and how it can be used in several attacks.
        - explain dns poisoning / spoofing
        - phishing
        - mitm
        - session hijacking
    - Demonstrate, and have all students set their DNS to Google or OpenDNS.
    - Explain what firewalls are and what they do to protect your computer.
        - While explaining, perform an nmap scan on the local network.
        - `time nmap -Pn 10.0.1.0/24` _make sure you set the correct address range_
    - Demonstrate, and have all students enable firewall.
        - After enabling firewalls, perform an nmap scan again on the local network.
        - `time nmap -Pn 10.0.1.0/24` _this should show that the OS still allows some ports in_
    - Explain what VPNs do, how they protect you (privacy) and how they don't protect you (local network)
        - Demonstrate IP (and maybe DNS) before and after enabling a VPN.
    - Explain the role of encryption and https while being a normal user or developer.
        - Demonstrate reading traffic on unencrypted channelss using Wireshark.
            - `tcp.port == 80`
            - go to unencrypted site
            - right click, export as, .gif, .jpg etc
1. Introduce Security as it relates to web application development.
    - Crypto Hash functions
        - Hash function which takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string, which is called the hash value
        - Message
            - can be anything, binary, utf8, image, string, file...
        - Function
            - takes in a message
            - outputs a message digest
            - one way hash
        - Digest (aka message digest, aka hash)
    - Salting Hashes
        - Good hashes are not meant to be fast
        - Hashes are salted
    - Password Security
    - Whiteboard example defining Bruteforce attacks
    - Whiteboard example defining Rainbow Table attacks
    - Using sensitive data in web applications
1. Live code hashing algorithms
    - MD5sum SHAsum hashing algorithms
    - Piping output and files
    - Generating hashes in Node.js
        - Bcrypt algorithm
1. Explain not committing sensitive data
    - using .gitignore
    - using git-crypt(optional)
    - using `ENV` vars in CLI and hiding from CLI history
1. Using `.env` files
1. (Optional) Assign Jon's `TubeHacked` exercise.
1. Assign students to add bcrypt to `Express-Gallery` and/or other CMS projects including user authentication.

# Exercises and Projects
The following exercises and projects state an average time alotted. A session is about 3 hours. There are 3 sessions in a day: (1) After the morning challenge up to lunch, (2) after lunch up to dinner, (3) after dinner until the end of class.

#### TubeHacked
- Link/Repo: [No Repository. Live coding exercise by Jon Borgonia, allowing incoming requests to change the youtube url, if password number is found by client.]
- Individual or Goup: *Individual*
- Sessions: 2 sessions
- Concepts: Bruteforce
- Notes: Bruteforce

[Add hashing to `Express Gallery` and/or other CMS project containing user authentication]
